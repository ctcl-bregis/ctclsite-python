## config.json

The "content" key contains configuration data on what pages are shown with what content and definitions of the buttons shown on the menus.

The layout of "content" is sort of like a file browser. Each subkey has a "type" key that is either "content" or "dir", "dir" would define another menu page and such key should contain another list of dictionaries for pages.
