The NetKart Automotive Network project, codenamed "Umbreon", is a project surrounding the upgrades and the addition of a computer network to an off-road go-kart.

## Phases
The project is split into multiple "phases", each one focusing on a certain part of the go-kart.

### Phase 2

Phase 2 covered getting the vehicle to a safe, drivable state, the phase was completed on March 7, 2021. Phase 2 surrounds general repairs then upgrades to the transmission and braking.

### Phase 3
Phase 3 is when I actually start adding the computer network.
