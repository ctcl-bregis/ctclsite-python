SVCS, nicknamed "Dracula's Castle", is the name given to any platform that I use for virtualization.

## Current
In early May 2023, I acquired an HP BladeSystem C3000 with three HP ProLiant BL460c G8 systems installed along with many other computer parts.

### SVCS1
SVCS1 would use the hardware platform "Methamphetamine". The system is used for general purpose hosting, mostly for browser-based applications.

Specifications, planned:

- System: HP ProLiant BL460c G8
- CPUs: 2x Intel Xeon E5-2697 v2
- Memory: 8x16GB (128GB) Micron Technology PC3-12800R 2Rx4 Registered ECC
- Storage: 1x HGST 600GB 10000RPM 6Gb/s SAS

### SVCS2
SVCS2 would use the hardware platform "Dextroamphetamine", the system is optimized for single-thread performance such as game servers.

Specifications:

- System: HP ProLiant BL460c G8
- CPUs: 2x Intel Xeon E5-2643 v2
- Memory: 64GB (8x8GB) Nanya Technology PC3-12800R 1Rx4 Registered ECC
- Storage: 1x HGST 600GB 10000RPM 6Gb/s SAS

### SVCS3
SVCS3 would use the hardware platform "Lisdexamfetamine". This is the oldest BL460c G8 in use. Currently the system is used for hosting Minecraft server instances.

Specifications:

- System: HP ProLiant BL460c G8
- CPUs: 2x Intel Xeon E5-2650
- Memory: 128GB (8x16GB) SK hynix PC3-12800R 2Rx4 Registered ECC
- Storage: 1x HGST 600GB 10000RPM 6Gb/s SAS

## Former
"Polyethylene" is the hardware codename to the X8DAi that formerly made up a dual Intel Xeon X5670 workstation desktop I used for the majority of 2021. In February 2023, I repurposed the motherboard to be used as my main server to be able to sell off the Dell and HP rack servers that I used prior.

On May 31, 2023, the former Supermicro-based SVCS "Polyethylene" was decomissioned for the time being. Later on, in September 2023, the motherboard was put back into its original configuration as a desktop.
