SVCS, nicknamed "Dracula's Castle", is the name given to any platform that I use for virtualization.

## Current
In early May 2023, I acquired an HP BladeSystem C3000 with three HP ProLiant BL460c G8 systems installed along with many other computer parts.

On May 31, 2023, the former Supermicro-based SVCS "Polyethylene" was decomissioned for the time being.  

As of July 25, 2023, just SVCS1 is active.

### SVCS1
SVCS1 would use the hardware platform "Methamphetamine", the system is optimized for larger amounts of virtual machines.

Specifications, planned:

- System: HP ProLiant BL460c G8
- CPUs: 2x Intel Xeon E5-2697 v2
- Memory: 8x16GB (128GB) Micron Technology PC3-12800R 2Rx4 Registered ECC
- Storage: 1x HGST 600GB 10000RPM 6Gb/s SAS

### SVCS2
SVCS2 would use the hardware platform "Dextroamphetamine", the system is optimized for single-thread performance such as game servers. 

Specifications, planned:

- System: HP ProLiant BL460c G8
- CPUs: 2x Intel Xeon E5-2643 v2
- Memory: 64GB (8x8GB) Nanya Technology PC3-12800R 1Rx4 Registered ECC
- Storage: 1x HGST 600GB 10000RPM 6Gb/s SAS

### SVCS3
SVCS3 would use the hardware platform "Lisdexamfetamine", the system is optimized for multi-thread but higher single-thread performance for use with AI and remote code compilation.

Specifications, planned:

- System: HP ProLiant BL460c G8
- CPUs: 2x Intel Xeon E5-2667 v2
- Memory: 128GB (8x16GB) SK hynix PC3-12800R 2Rx4 Registered ECC
- Storage: 1x HGST 600GB 10000RPM 6Gb/s SAS

## Former 
"Polyethylene" is the hardware codename to the X8DAi that formerly made up a dual Intel Xeon X5670 workstation desktop I used for the majority of 2021. In February 2023, I repurposed the motherboard to be used as my main server to be able to sell off the Dell and HP rack servers that I used prior.

Specifications, as of April 27, 2023:

- Motherboard: Supermicro X8DAi
- Chassis: Supermicro CSE-825
- CPUs: 2x Intel Xeon X5670
- Memory: 6x 8GB Qimonda IMHH8GP22A1F2C-10F Registered ECC DDR3-1066
- Storage: 2x 1TB WD Black 7200RPM SATA
- Storage controller: LSI MegaRAID 9260-4i
- Network: 2x Integrated Intel Gbit + 2x Quad-port Gbit HP NC364T
