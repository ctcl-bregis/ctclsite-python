MediaCow Touch 1 "Nashville" was a project for building a tablet computer. Planning for the project started in October 2020 and the device was built from November 22-24, 2020. 

It utilized the Banana Pi M64 Single Board Computer. This board was chosen over others at the time because the board had a connector for the AXP803's battery interface.
