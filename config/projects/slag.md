SLAG is a bot for the management of Discord guilds. SLAG is an initialism of "Security, Logging, Analytics and General Purpose". The logo is based off from this, with the goal of the bot to be "solid as steel". The project was started on January 24, 2024 in response to myself becoming president of a school club.

Details of the bot including its features and code can be found at the repostitory [here](https://github.com/ctcl-bregis/slag).

SLAG is the first project where I have written SQL statements for setting up databases.
