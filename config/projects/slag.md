SLAG is a bot for the management of Discord guilds. SLAG is an initialism of "Security, Logging, Analytics and General Purpose". The logo is based off from this, with the goal of the bot to be "solid as steel".

The bot currently uses the [discord.py library](https://github.com/Rapptz/discord.py) and it is my first Discord bot to reach production.

The project was started on January 24, 2024.
