MediaCow Touch "Nashville" was a project for building a tablet computer. Planning for the project started in October 2020 and the device was built from November 22-24, 2020. At the time, it was my most advanced project, taking thourough planning.

It utilized the Banana Pi M64 Single Board Computer. This board was chosen over others at the time because the board had a connector for the AXP803's battery interface.

## Planning
In 2020, this was a massive undertaking given my skillset at the time. All of the planning was done within LaTeX formatted documents. 

## Construction
The case was built from plywood reused from a 50-60's era phono radio system. The front bezel was reused from a digital photo frame and consisted of (presumably) solid aluminum. The case was put together using hot glue and wood screws.

The end result was quite heavy and possibly dangerous, usually requiring two hands to hold the device. 

## Legacy 

The device is still fully functional after three years, as of December 2023.
