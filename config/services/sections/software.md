I can aid in the design and development of various types of software. 

## Language Experience
I mainly use the Python programming language for server-side and client-side software projects because of its popularity and ease of use, allowing myself to complete projects faster.

For software in applications that require performance such as embedded devices and data processing, the Rust programming language is used. Other languages are used when they are needed.

### Advanced Experience
I have the most experience with these programming languages in these applications.

- Python - Server/web applications
    - Flask and Django web frameworks
        - [This Website - ctclsite-python](../projects/ctclsite/)
        - [ContactList](../projects/contactlist/)
        - [ToDoKiosk](../projects/todokiosk) 
        - [CAMS](../projects/cams/)
    - Pycord, discord.py bot frameworks
        - [SLAG](../projects/slag/)

### Intermediate Experience
I have some experience with these programming languages in these applications.

- C# - Game development
    - So far only used in the context of making mods for games using the Unity game engine
- Python - Embedded
    - MicroPython, CircuitPython for ARMv7E-M (Atmel/Microchip SAMD51), ARMv6-M (Raspberry Pi RP2040)
        - Modifications to the [Adafruit "EZ Make Oven"](https://learn.adafruit.com/ez-make-oven/installing-the-code) code
        - Some experimentation with the Raspberry Pi Pico

### Beginner Experience
I do not have that much experience in these programming languages in the listed applications but I am willing to learn more about them.

- Rust - Server/web applications
    - Actix Web
        - [ctclsite-rust](../projects/ctclsite/)
- Rust - Embedded
    - ARMv7E-M (Atmel/Microchip SAMD51)
        - So far just hardware experimentation, no use in projects yet
- JavaScript - Web applications
    - Minimal general use within web applications, sometimes with jQuery
        - [This Website - ctclsite-python](../projects/ctclsite/)
- C - Embedded
    - AVR (Atmel/Microchip ATMEGA), ARMv6-M (NXP/Freescale Kinetis)
        - [MediaCow Touch "Nashville"](../projects/mct1/) 
        - Various school projects
